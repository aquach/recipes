From Holly Ho (holly.ai.ho@gmail.com):
My baby cousin can't pronounce "banana" correctly — he calls them "boyayas".
This recipe makes, like, 3 loaves — so you might want to cut it down a bit. Haha.

4 c flour
3/4 tsp baking soda
3/4 tsp baking powder
1 tsp salt
2 c sugar
1/2 c butter @ room temp
3 c smashed bananas
4 eggs
2/3 c plain yogurt

quartered:
1 c flour
< 1/4 tsp baking soda
< 1/4 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 c sugar
1/8 c butter
1 c smashed bananas
1 egg
~ 1/8 c yogurt plus a little extra

- preheat 350 
- mix flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt in a bowl
- in another bowl, cream the sugar and butter
- mix in banana, eggs, yogurt
- mix in dry ingredients 

- for loaves, bake for ~1hr 10min. 
- for muffins, bake ~35min. 
- just stick a toothpick in and make sure it comes out dry! :)

... for extra deliciousness:
1 c chocolate chips or Nutella

- melt chocolate chips
- take half your batter and mix with the melted chocolate chips (or Nutella!)
- alternate spoonfuls of normal batter and chocolate batter into your pan

woo!
