Peppermint Bark Cookies
Adapted from http://www.barbarabakes.com/2012/11/chocolate-peppermint-crunch-cookies/

1 3/4 cups flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cups cocoa powder
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
3/4 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup granulated sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup white chocolate chips
1 cup smashed peppermint candies

Preheat oven to 350 and line cookie sheets with parchment or silpat liners.
In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking soda and salt. Sift cocoa and add to flour mixture. (I like to use a fine mesh strainer and sift the cocoa right over the bowl with the flour.) Set aside.
In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter and sugars until light and fluffy. Add eggs and vanilla and mix until well combined.
Stir in flour mixture until just combined. Mix in Peppermint Crunch chips and white chocolate chips.
Using a medium cookie scoop, drop onto prepared baking sheets.
Bake for 9-11 minutes. Cookies will still be soft in the middle. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.

TODO:
Would be much better with more white chocolate. Try 2:1 chips/peppermint ratio
Do NOT OVERBAKE!!! Cookies will collapse into pancakes. 350deg at 9 min is plenty.
