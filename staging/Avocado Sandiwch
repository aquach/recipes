A delicious easy snack with saurkraut that I learned from my New Zealand friend is to combine the following:
1) Toasted Bread - ideally sourdough bread
2) Avacado slices
3) Saurkraut
4) Pepper

Place the avacado slices, at room temperature or slight warmer, to the toasted bread so that the avo slices become a little creamy and melt...then add the saurkraut and pepper. The toast, creamy avo and saurkraut are delicious!
